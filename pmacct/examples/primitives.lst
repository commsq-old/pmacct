! aggregate_primitives: list of custom-defined primitives
!
! File syntax is key-based. Position of keys inside the same row (rule) is not
! relevant; Spaces are not allowed (ie. 'id = 1' is not valid). The first full
! match wins (like in firewall rules).
!
! list of currently supported keys follows:
!
! 'name'		Primitive name: it will be used as identifier of the
!			primitive itself and hence must be unique. This name
!			can be used in 'aggregate' statements to include the
!			primitive as part of plugin aggregation methods.
! 'field_type'		Applies to NetFlow v9/IPFIX: defines which field type
!			(Element ID) to select. Optionally, a PEN value can be
!			supplied aswell via the <PEN>:<value> format. As ai
!			reference the IPFIX standard IE definition table can be
!			used: http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xhtml
! 'len'			Length of the primitive, in bytes. Variable length 
!			fields are not supported yet. 
! 'semantics'		Specifies semantics of the primitive. Allowed values
!			are: 'u_int' (unsigned integer, presented as decimal
!			number), 'hex' (unsigned integer, presented as hexa-
!			decimal number), 'ip' (IP address), 'mac' (MAC address)
!			and 'str' (string). 
! 
! Examples:
!
! Defines a primitive called 'mtla': it picks NetFlow v9/IPFIX field type #47
! (mplsTopLabelIPv4Address), reads for 4 bytes (since it's expected to be an
! IPv4 address) and will present it as an IP address. 
! In an 'aggregate' statement this primitive would be intuitively recalled by
! its name, 'mtla'.
!
name=mtla	field_type=47	len=4	semantics=ip
!
! Defines a primitive called 'mtlpl': it picks NetFlow v9/IPFIX field type #91
! (mplsTopLabelPrefixLength), reads for 1 byte (since it's expected to be a
! prefix length/network mask) and will present it as a decimal unsigned int.
!
name=mtlpl	field_type=91	len=1	semantics=u_int
!
! Defines a primitive called 'alu_91': it picks NetFlow v9/IPFIX field type
! #91 and PEN #637 (Alcatel-Lucent), reads for 2 bytes and will present it as
! a hexadecimal.
!
name=alu_91	field_type=637:91	len=2	semantics=hex
